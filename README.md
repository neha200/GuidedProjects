## Pet-Profiler Java Applet Project

In this guided project I was supposed to make few changes in the given program to display an applet and when values entered like name and age in human years we can tell how old the respective pet is along with its name.

## COVID19 Data Analysis using Python

in this Course we worked with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, another dataset consisting of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. Then these two datasets are merged to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
